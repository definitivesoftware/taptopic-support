# TapTopic Support

Welcome to the support page for TapTopic, an AAC device app designed to help users improve their lexical diversity and communication skills through the use of words and symbols.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How to use TapTopic?
TapTopic is composed of two key components: Topics and Topic Displays.

- **Topics**: These are containers or general areas of interest that hold one or more Topic Displays. You are free to create as many Topics as you'd like.

- **Topic Displays**: This is an interactive area within the app that has lists of subjects, actions, descriptions, objects, prepositions, and miscellaneous items. You can select word(s) from each list and it will appear in a dedicated screen area. When touching this area, it will use text-to-speech to voice the phrase. After the phrase is voiced, it clears and makes room for the next phrase.

You can create new Topics and save associated Topic Displays on your device.

### Where do I start?
You should see an empty "General" folder, but not much else at this time. Your first step will be create a "Topic".

### How do I create a Topic?
To create a new Topic, click on the circle plus button on the right corner of the Topics navigation. This will open a screen to input the Topic name as well as which folder it belongs to. Each Topic belongs to one Folder.

If you need to you can change the folder anytime, so no need to get this right the first time! The "General" folder is included at application install and this is the default location for Topics. The Topics in "General" can be deleted, but the folder "General" cannot be deleted. All other Folders can be deleted.

### How do I create a Folder?
To create a Folder, click on the folder plus icon above the word Topics. This opens the "Add Folder" view where you can input a Folder name (e.g, School, Home, Play).

### How do I enter a new Topic Display item?
You should now have a Folder and a Topic. A helpful first step is to close the Topics navigation (swipe-left or click the left most icon) to show the full Topic screen. 

You should see your Topic at the top of the display - but it's empty! Let's add some words to each category (note: at anytime you can select Settings (bottom-right cog wheel) to show/hide categories). Touch the Edit "lock" icon to enter edit mode. You will see a green button for "Add New Word and Image". Pressing on that opens the "Add Word" view. From here you can type in a word in the "Word" textfield. 

### Adding a word
TapTopic will try to automatically guess the correct category for the word you entered, however you can change this manually if needed. Please only enter one word, not a phrase. Next, as you type the letters of a word, the app makes an API call to ARASAAC to search for a matching symbol. You can select one of these symbols and it will be highlighted in it's own box. You can also choose "No Image" if you don't want a symbol to show just for this word. If there is no suitable symbol, you can search a few images from Google Images, or otherwise upload your own by pressing on "Use your own image". 

When you hit "Save" the word will be added to your Word Categorty View on the Topic Display. You should see it when you close the Add Word view by hitting Close on the top left-hand side of the modal.

#### Favorites
You can choose to make a word a favorite by changing the on/off toggle. A favorite word can be pre-loaded onto new Topics using the "Import Favorites" button in edit mode - this should save time if a word is frequently used. It will keep whatever image is assigned to the word. 

#### Pronounce As
You can change how the word is pronounced by the text-to-speech voice by typing in a phonetic representatioon of the word. Each time this word is selected it will use the pronounce as instead. If pronounce as is blank, it will default to the normal word articulation.

#### Word Background Color
Select a color from the template to change the background of the word in the word categories view.

#### Editing a Word
When back in the Word Category View while in Edit mode you can long-press (hold down) the word you want to edit and it will show a context menu. Here you can change the category and favorite status of the word, and also delete the word. To change the word itself or image, we recommend simply deleting the word and starting over. 

## There are essentially 3 different types of displays in TapTopic:

### Text-To-Speech Display
To start building sentences and word recognition, simply touch the word and it will appear in the Selected Words view. To pronounce the word or phrase, press the speak icon on the right side. To delete a word, press the red back arrow on the left side of the Selected Words view. To clear all words hold down the red back arrow button until you see the context-menu to "Clear All Words".

### Text-To-Symbol Display
The Text-To-Symbol display allows the user to type in the actual words one letter at a time in order to build sytnactic structure. It will automatically load the default image for the word entered. 

Toggling the "Type" option on the upper left-side of the Topic Display, it will expand the Selected Words view to allow you to type a word. Enter a word here and press enter and the image will display below. You can even type in full sentences and the corresponding image will be shown for each word in the correct order! If a word you type is a word that already exists for the Topic it will use that word and image, along with your pronounciation preferences.

Hit "Clear" to clear your words and start fresh. Press the speak symbol to hear the words/phrases. When done, simply hit the toggle again for the Type option.

### Topic Image Display
The Topic Image display allows you have an image representation that you can associate words to. For instance, if you can upload a picture to work on descriptive language by having the user describe what they see. 

You can also combine the Text-To-Symbol display and the Topic Image display to let the user type the words associated with your image. 

You can more than one image and you can simply swipe through each image. 

When adding a Topic Image, you have to enter a word or sentence description of it in order for it to save. You can then toggle "Show Phrase" while in Topic Image mode to show the word/phrase above the image. This word/phrase is usually what you want the user to type in or select from the word category view. It is hidden by default.

To delete a Topic Image long press (hold down) until you see the context menu with the option to delete. Deleting the Topic Image removes it from the list of Topic Images for the selected Topic.
