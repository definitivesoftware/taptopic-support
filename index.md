# TapTopic Support

Welcome to the support page for TapTopic, an AAC device app designed to help users improve their lexical diversity and communication skills through the use of words and symbols.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How to use TapTopic?
TapTopic is composed of two key components: Topics and Topic Displays.

- **Topics**: These are containers or general areas of interest that hold one or more Topic Displays.

- **Topic Displays**: This is an interactive area within the app that has lists of subjects, actions, descriptions, objects, prepositions, and miscellaneous items. You can select word(s) from each list and it will appear in a dedicated screen area. When touching this area, it will use text-to-speech to voice the phrase. After the phrase is voiced, it clears and makes room for the next phrase.

You can create new Topics and save them to a Topic Display on your device.

### How do I enter a new Topic Display item?
When entering a new Topic Display item, you'll be shown a keyboard. As you type the letters of a word, the app makes an API call to ARASAAC to search for a matching symbol.
